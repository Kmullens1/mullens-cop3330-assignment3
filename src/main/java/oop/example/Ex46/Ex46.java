        creating word clouds and other types of word analysis. And itâ€™s more useful when
        running it against lots of text.
        Create a program that reads in a file and counts the frequency of words in the file.
        Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency, and display the
        histogram to the screen.
        Example Output
            - Given the text file words.txt with this content
                badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom snake badger badger badger
            - the program would produce the following output:
                badger: *******
                mushroom: **
                snake: *
        Constraint
            Ensure that the most used word is at the top of the report and the least used words
            are at the bottom.*/
